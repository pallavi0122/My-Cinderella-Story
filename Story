once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella. When she was 10 years old , her mother died.
Her father married another woman so that Cinderella can have a mother. But her new stepmother already had 2 daughters
When they came home they were very nice to her. But as soon as her father went away for work , they started
treating her very cruelly.
One day her father went to a different country, for work, and never came home. He had died while travelling.
Now her stepmother and stepsisters took over her home and fired all the servants. They made Cinderella do all the 
housework as if she were a servant.
